# Space-Brothers_monetization
We have data on events for the mobile game Space Brothers. 
Players have to create their own space programs and try to colonize the galaxy.  
The dataset contains data on the first users of the app â€” the cohort of users who began playing the game between May 4 and 10, inclusive.  
The dataset contains data on users in the first stage of the game. 
To reach the second stage, they need to do one of the following:  
- Defeat the first boss 
- Build an orbital satellite-assembly system 
Research question: What monetization strategy should be used? For now, showing ads on the screen where the user selects the type of objects to be constructed is proposed
